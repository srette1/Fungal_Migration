# Fungal_Migration
Notebooks, image files and metadata for the analysis of hyphal growth in microfluidics

This is where we can store working versions of files to to analyze time-lapse images of fungi growing in microfluidic environments.
We do not intend to formally distribute or publish these items, but use this space to capture what is working.
